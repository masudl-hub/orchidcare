## 📝 Veo/Sora Prompt (Direct Generation)

```
Create a premium product video for "Orchid", an AI plant care assistant accessible through iMessage. 

Visual style: Brutalist botanical aesthetic combining hard geometric UI elements with organic plant imagery. Warm cream and stone gray color palette with pure black borders and shadows. Editorial typography mixing serif headlines with monospace UI text.

The video opens with cinematic macro footage of Monstera leaves unfurling in soft natural light, slowly revealing the title "ORCHID - Intelligent Botany" in large serif typography.

Transition to an iMessage conversation mockup with a white background and black 2px borders. A user sends a photo of a Monstera plant asking "What plant is this?" After animated typing dots, the AI responds with species identification showing "MONSTERA DELICIOSA" in bold, "98% MATCH" in a black badge, and personalized context about the user's watering habits and cat safety.

Show a diagnosis scene where the AI identifies a sick plant, recognizes it from the user's collection, and provides numbered treatment steps in a clean card interface.

Feature a futuristic "Memory Orb" visualization—a holographic sphere on black background with floating nodes showing user preferences (pet names, location, care habits) connected by pulsing light lines.

Display proactive notification cards stacking and sliding in—frost warnings with urgent black styling, check-in messages, seasonal tips—each with timestamps and the "V" logo.

Include a minimal map visualization showing nearby nurseries with numbered pins and real-time inventory data.

Show a 2x2 grid of plant propagation steps with photos, numbered badges, and descriptions appearing sequentially.

End with a video call interface mockup—live indicator, timer, call controls, and subtitle overlay of the AI providing real-time diagnosis.

Final frame: "Start Growing Today" CTA button with signature shadow effect.

Throughout: maintain consistent brutalist UI language with hard shadows (4-8px offset), 2px black borders, rounded corners, and technical annotations like "FIG 2.1 - SPECIES IDENTIFICATION" in small monospace text.

Mood: Premium, organic, slightly editorial. Like an Apple product video meets botanical illustration. Ambient electronic soundtrack with organic textures.
